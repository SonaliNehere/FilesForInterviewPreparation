1. Arrays.stream(arr) doesn’t work for a char[] array.
That method is only overloaded for:
int[]
long[]
double[]
T[] (object arrays)
Since char is a primitive type, you can’t use Arrays.stream(char[]) directly.

2. The s.chars() method returns an IntStream.
When you cast inside map, you’re still producing an IntStream.
To get a stream of characters, use mapToObj() instead.
s.chars() → gives an IntStream of Unicode values.
.mapToObj(c -> (char)c) → converts each code into a Character.
.filter(c -> s.indexOf(c) == s.lastIndexOf(c)) → keeps only unique characters.
.findFirst() → picks the first such character in the order they appear.
.ifPresent(System.out::println) → prints it safely (avoids NoSuchElementException).
